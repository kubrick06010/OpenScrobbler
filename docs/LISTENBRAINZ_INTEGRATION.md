# ListenBrainz Integration

This document defines how `OpenScrobbler` integrates with ListenBrainz today and where that integration should go next.

The product position is simple:

- ListenBrainz is the primary account and archive backend.
- MusicBrainz identifiers are the preferred metadata spine.
- Local-first storage, exports, and memory features remain a core differentiator.
- Legacy provider-era code may still exist during migration, but it is not a product goal and should not shape new UX or architecture.

## Product Scope

ListenBrainz in `OpenScrobbler` should cover:

- token-based account setup
- `playing_now` and completed listen submission
- durable queueing and per-backend diagnostics where applicable
- recent listens and archive charts
- followers and following
- similar users and compatibility
- recommendations
- pins
- playlists
- artist geography
- radio and affinity-based discovery
- metadata enrichment hooks that preserve MBIDs wherever possible

## Current State

Already present in the app:

- app-owned local token storage under Application Support
- token validation and username resolution
- native JSON submission for `playing_now` and completed listens
- recent listens, top artists, top releases, top recordings, and total listen counts
- followers, following, and recommendation flows
- playlist and pin support
- artist origins and artist affinity graph experiments
- deterministic tests for the core ListenBrainz flows already implemented

Still incomplete:

- compatibility view and overlap UX for comparing users
- richer retry and rate-limit handling in the client core
- OpenAPI-aligned fixtures for broader payload coverage
- MusicBrainz enrichment and metadata quality surfacing
- JSPF import/export and local resolution workflows

## Account Model

ListenBrainz settings should remain centered on:

- enablement
- token entry
- validation status
- resolved username
- optional custom base URL for compatible deployments
- toggles for `playing_now` and completed listens when needed

The token is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/OpenScrobbler/Secrets/listenbrainz-token` with user-only file permissions. This avoids repeated macOS Keychain prompts during local development builds. Non-sensitive state such as "token present" is cached separately to keep launch and test flows quiet.

## Submission Model

### `playing_now`

Payload shape:

```json
{
  "listen_type": "playing_now",
  "payload": [
    {
      "track_metadata": {
        "artist_name": "Portishead",
        "track_name": "The Rip",
        "release_name": "Third"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### completed listen

Payload shape:

```json
{
  "listen_type": "single",
  "payload": [
    {
      "listened_at": 1779164400,
      "track_metadata": {
        "artist_name": "Portishead",
        "track_name": "The Rip",
        "release_name": "Third",
        "additional_info": {
          "media_player": "OpenScrobbler",
          "submission_client": "OpenScrobbler",
          "submission_client_version": "0.1.0"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Mapping from app `Track`:

- `track.title` -> `track_name`
- `track.artist` -> `artist_name`
- `track.album` -> `release_name`
- scrobble completion time -> `listened_at`
- `track.sourceApp` -> `additional_info.media_player` when useful

## Service Architecture

`ListenBrainzService` should continue evolving toward a small reusable request core:

- shared request building
- token injection
- spec-aligned decoding
- 429-aware retry and backoff
- consistent HTTP and transport error mapping
- generic fallback methods for unsupported endpoints

This keeps the service maintainable as we add more endpoints from the ListenBrainz ecosystem.

## Archive Surfaces

The archive layer should treat ListenBrainz as the main source for:

- recent listens
- top artists, releases, and recordings
- total listen counts
- artist map
- user-to-user compatibility
- similar users
- radio-derived affinity exploration

Where possible, archive entities should preserve MBIDs so later MusicBrainz enrichment and local-resolution features become easier.

## Social And Discovery

The main open-social surface should be built around:

- followers
- following
- similar users
- compatibility score
- artists in common
- recommendation sharing
- pinned recordings
- playlists and recommendation playlists

Important note:

- compatibility should come from ListenBrainz `similar-to`
- "artists in common" is a useful app-level derivation and can be computed by intersecting top artists for both users

## Playlist And Local Ownership Direction

ListenBrainz playlists should not remain an isolated cloud feature inside the app.

The medium-term direction is:

- export playlist-like content as JSPF-compatible artifacts
- import public ListenBrainz playlists for local use
- track unresolved MBIDs when local files cannot be matched
- evolve `Shared` and `Obsessions` toward open, MusicBrainz-aware artifacts

This aligns `OpenScrobbler` with the broader open ecosystem rather than creating a private side format.

## Testing Requirements

The ListenBrainz test suite should cover:

- token validation
- missing token behavior
- invalid token behavior
- request decoding for charts, social, playlists, pins, artist map, and radio
- compatibility and similar users payloads
- partial and sparse payloads
- custom base URL behavior
- retry and error mapping behavior once the request core is refactored
- token-store isolation and quiet startup behavior

Fixtures should prefer payloads cross-checked against the ListenBrainz OpenAPI spec.

## Next Steps

1. Add compatibility UI and "artists in common" to `Social`.
2. Refactor `ListenBrainzService` around a shared request pipeline with retry/backoff.
3. Broaden OpenAPI-aligned fixtures and tests.
4. Add JSPF export/import groundwork.
5. Add MusicBrainz enrichment and provenance surfacing.
